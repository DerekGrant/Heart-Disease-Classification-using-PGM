<p>In this project, we implemented naive bayes model on a data set of heart disease.(UCI Heart Disease Data). Pre processing operations like discretizing continuous values and filling missing values were done. 2 probabilistic graphical model and 3 bayesian network using different subsets of data were designed and evaluated.</p>
